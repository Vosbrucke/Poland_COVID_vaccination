# Project code used in the project

Note: Code_infection and Code_vaccination R scripts download data from website and store the data on your computer. You cannot find the data downloaded using these scripts on Github as there size was too big and there is no incentive to upload them whatsoever. Right now they are have not been uploaded since 19 May, 2022 so the processing of the data from the scripts stored in Processed_data is still up-to-date. Once thing change in the term of new data availability I will try to adjust the code if needed.
